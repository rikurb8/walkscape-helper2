# Crafting

> Combine components with your endless creativity and craftsmanship to produce artisanal tools and equipment.

The **Crafting** [skill](index.md) allows you to create [tools](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Tools "Tools") like fishing rods, pickaxes, and hatchets which are needed to train other skills. Tools can be crafted in six different [qualities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Qualities "Qualities") and using [fine materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fine_materials "Fine materials") will increase your chances of making a higher quality tool. With higher crafting levels, you'll be able to use more materials to make better tools as well as use special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your crafting efficiency. You can also receive [Crafting Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_Chests "Crafting Chests") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Crafting level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Crafting Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_chest "Crafting chest").

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Crafting Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_chest "Crafting chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

These activities award Crafting experience as a bonus in addition to the main activity skill. Items [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") that include "While Crafting" do not apply to these activities.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Crafting Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_Chests "Crafting Chests") if they have a Crafting level requirement.

## Recipes

The following activities are completed through recipes and thus require [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Additionally, they may have service requirements, usually in the form of a service location. All recipes produce one of the final products by default.

Crafting also gets a bonus of +1 [Crafting Outcome](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_Outcome "Crafting Outcome") per level beyond a [Crafting Recipe's](../recipes/index.md) level requirement toward [crafted items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_items "Crafted items") with no cap.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Crafting chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_chest "Crafting chest").

## Trivia

-   Due to Steel Tools requiring [Maple Planks](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Maple_Plank "Maple Plank") to make them, new players are often confused about where to find [maple trees](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Maple_trees "Maple trees"). Thinking that they should still be able to find them in [Jarvonia](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Jarvonia "Jarvonia"), while they are one of the first things they discover are unique to the [GDTE](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Trellin-Erdwise_\(GDTE\) "Grand Duchy of Trellin-Erdwise (GDTE)") region - requiring the [Jarvonian Letter of Passage](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Jarvonian_Letter_of_Passage "Jarvonian Letter of Passage").
-   New players usually want to Craft a [Wooden Fishing Pole](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Wooden_Fishing_Pole "Wooden Fishing Pole") and get confused on where to get [Fishing Line](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fishing_Line "Fishing Line"), thinking they should be able craft it. However, you can find this for sale at the [Frosthook Emporium](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Frosthook_Emporium "Frosthook Emporium") fishing store in [Port Skildar](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Port_Skildar "Port Skildar") in quantities of 100 daily for 3 money each as well as from certain [activities](../activities/index.md).
