# Fishing

> Cast out your nets and lines in search of the countless species living under the surface of the waters of Arenum.

The **Fishing** [skill](index.md) is straightforward - you catch different species of fish. Fish can be cooked with the [Cooking](cooking.md) skill to turn them into [consumables](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Consumables "Consumables"). With higher fishing levels, you will have access to more fish, better fishing [tools](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Tools "Tools"), and special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your fishing efficiency. You can also receive [Fishing Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fishing_Chests "Fishing Chests") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") has a Fishing level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Fishing Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fishing_chest "Fishing chest").

When performing an [activity](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Fishing Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fishing_chest "Fishing chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

These activities award Fishing experience as a bonus in addition to the main activity skill. Items [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") that include "While Fishing" do not apply to these activities.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Fishing Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fishing_Chests "Fishing Chests") if they have a Fishing level requirement.
