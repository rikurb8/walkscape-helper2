# Cooking

> Carefully select natural ingredients and turn them into delicious feasts that will make stomachs rumble and mouths water.

The **Cooking** [skill](index.md) allows you to prepare [consumables](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Consumables "Consumables") which can give temporary skilling boosts. Some recipes are simple (like cooking fish) while others are more complex, requiring many [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). With higher cooking levels, you'll have access to more cooking ingredients, better recipes, and special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your cooking efficiency. You can also receive [Cooking Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Cooking_Chests "Cooking Chests") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Cooking level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Cooking Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Cooking_chest "Cooking chest").

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Cooking Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Cooking_chest "Cooking chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

No activities give bonus Cooking experience.

## Recipes

The following activities are completed through recipes and thus require [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Additionally, they may have service requirements, usually in the form of a service location. All recipes produce one of the final products by default.

Cooking also gets a bonus of +1 [Crafting Outcome](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_Outcome "Crafting Outcome") per level beyond a [Cooking Recipe's](../recipes/index.md) level requirement toward [crafted items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_items "Crafted items") with no cap.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Cooking chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Cooking_chest "Cooking chest").
