# Smithing

> Use blazing forges to smelt ores into metal bars, and hammer them into armour or craft useful tools with them.

The **Smithing** [skill](index.md) allows you to smelt ores into bars as well as create different types of combat equipment. With higher smithing levels, you'll have access to more ores, be able to create better equipment, and use special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your smithing efficiency. You can also receive [Smithing Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Smithing_chest "Smithing chest") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Smithing level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Smithing Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Smithing_chest "Smithing chest").

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Smithing Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Smithing_chest "Smithing chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

These activities award Smithing experience as a bonus in addition to the main activity skill. Items [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") that include "While Smithing" do not apply to these activities.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Smithing Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Smithing_Chests "Smithing Chests") if they have a Smithing level requirement.

## Recipes

The following activities are completed through recipes and thus require [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Additionally, they may have service requirements, usually in the form of a service location. All recipes produce one of the final products by default.

Smithing also gets a bonus of +1 [Crafting Outcome](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_Outcome "Crafting Outcome") per level beyond a [Smithing Recipe's](../recipes/index.md) level requirement toward [crafted items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_items "Crafted items") with no cap.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Smithing chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Smithing_chest "Smithing chest").
