# Mining

> Make your way over mountains and through caves to dig out precious ores and gemstones.

The **Mining** [skill](index.md) allows you to extract ores and [gems](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Gems "Gems"). Ores can be processed into bars with the [Smithing](smithing.md) skill. With higher Mining levels, you'll have access to more ores, better pickaxes, and special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your mining efficiency. You can also receive [Mining Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Mining_Chests "Mining Chests") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Mining level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Mining Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Mining_chest "Mining chest").

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Mining Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Mining_chest "Mining chest").
