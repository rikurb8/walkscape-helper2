# Woodcutting

> Harvest timber from the vast forests of Arenum, yielding raw materials that are essential in the world's industries.

The **Woodcutting** [skill](index.md) allows you to gather logs from chopping trees. Logs can be processed into planks with the [Carpentry](carpentry.md) skill. With higher Woodcutting levels, you'll have access to more trees, better hatchets, and special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your woodcutting efficiency. You can also receive [Woodcutting Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Woodcutting_Chests "Woodcutting Chests") and [Bird Nests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Bird_Nests "Bird Nests") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Woodcutting level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Woodcutting Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Woodcutting_chest "Woodcutting chest"). Additionally, activities involving cutting trees have a chance to drop [Bird Nests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Bird_Nests "Bird Nests") as well.

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Woodcutting Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Woodcutting_chest "Woodcutting chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

These activities award Woodcutting experience as a bonus in addition to the main activity skill. Items [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") that include "While Woodcutting" do not apply to these activities.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Woodcutting Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Woodcutting_Chests "Woodcutting Chests") if they have a Woodcutting level requirement.

- GNAT Encon (enconvenient) was the first person to reach 99 in a skill with woodcutting and was awarded an IRL cape from Schamppu as an achievement during the closed beta test.
