# Foraging

> Search for resources and treasures, overgrown by plants, buried in the sand, or anywhere else in the diverse environment of Arenum.

The **Foraging** [skill](index.md) allows you to gather things from nature and urban areas. Forests, hills, and plains are a good source to find plants and seeds that can be used for the [Cooking](cooking.md) and future [Farming](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Farming "Farming") skills while towns and cities contain materials used in the [Crafting](crafting.md) and [Smithing](smithing.md) skills. With higher Foraging levels, you'll have access to more items, better foraging [tools](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Tools "Tools"), and special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your foraging efficiency. You can also receive [Foraging Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Foraging_Chests "Foraging Chests") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Foraging level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Foraging Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Foraging_chest "Foraging chest").

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Foraging Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Foraging_chest "Foraging chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

These activities award Foraging experience as a bonus in addition to the main activity skill. Items [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") that include "While Foraging" do not apply to these activities.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Foraging Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Foraging_Chests "Foraging Chests") if they have a Foraging level requirement.
