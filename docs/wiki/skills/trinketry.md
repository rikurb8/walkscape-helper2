# Trinketry

> The art of gemistry, gemology and jewelcrafting - the creation of beautiful and valuable items from precious stones.

The **Trinketry** [skill](index.md) allows you to shape rough gems into cut gems as well as create rings and amulets. With higher Trinketry levels, you'll have access to more recipes, be able to create better equipment, and use special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your Trinketry efficiency. You can also receive [Trinketry chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Trinketry_chest "Trinketry chest") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Trinketry level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Trinketry Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Trinketry_chest "Trinketry chest").

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Trinketry Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Trinketry_chest "Trinketry chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

No activities give bonus Trinketry experience.

## Recipes

The following activities are completed through recipes and thus require [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Additionally, they may have service requirements, usually in the form of a service location. All recipes produce one of the final products by default.

Trinketry also gets a bonus of +1 [Crafting Outcome](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_Outcome "Crafting Outcome") per level beyond a [Trinketry Recipe's](../recipes/index.md) level requirement toward [crafted items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_items "Crafted items") with no cap.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Trinketry chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Trinketry_chest "Trinketry chest").
