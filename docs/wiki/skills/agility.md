# Agility

> Breathe in the fresh air while exercising in nature, adventuring through Arenum, and discovering treasures!

The **Agility** [skill](index.md) is inherently linked to traveling between locations. You level up your agility simply by traveling, and the higher your level, the better agility [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") you can equip to travel faster. Equipment like [Skis](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Skis "Skis") or the [Grappling Hook](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Grappling_Hook "Grappling Hook") can change the steps required across different types of terrain. In the future, as you travel, you'll also encounter random events like small quests or interesting discoveries and pick up things along the way. You can also receive [Agility Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Agility_Chests "Agility Chests") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Traveling

**Traveling** will be one of the main ways the player will passively gain agility [experience](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Skill_Experience "Skill Experience"), as it is unavoidable activity for going places and playing the game. The amount of exp gained from traveling changes throughout leveling the [skill](index.md). The amount of base steps changes for going to each location based on distances from one another (see all the [routes here](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Routes "Routes")). The total amount of steps to get to the next closest location will get divided into 10 action nodes to fulfill, which will then count as the player arriving at that location.

In addition to the variation in experience gained from traveling, so does the chance to obtain [Agility Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Agility_Chests "Agility Chests"), which scales with the base steps required to reach a location instead of the base rate per action completion.

**Traveling is unaffected by any penalties suffered from having an [over-filled inventory](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Inventory#Overencumbered "Inventory").**

There is no efficiency cap on the traveling activity. However there is a 100 step minimum between 2 locations (10 steps per node).

See [Traveling (Mechanics)](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Traveling_\(Mechanics\) "Traveling (Mechanics)") for more information on calculations for experience and efficiency.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Agility level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Agility Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Agility_chest "Agility chest").

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Agility Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Agility_chest "Agility chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

These activities award Agility experience as a bonus in addition to the main activity skill. Items [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") that include "While Agility" do not apply to these activities.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Agility Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Agility_Chests "Agility Chests") if they have a Agility level requirement.
