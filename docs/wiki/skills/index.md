# Skills

There are currently 10 skills in WalkScape.

All skills in WalkScape are trained through taking steps in the real world. Each step contributes to an action, and completing actions grants experience to the corresponding skill.

Skills start at level 1 and through [leveling progression](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Skill_Experience "Skill Experience") can be leveled up until level 99, where they will only gain experience in the skill but no further levels.

The Total Level represents the sum of all of the current levels a character has.

There is also a [Character Level](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Character_Level "Character Level") that is a "pure" representation of how much you've walked in total. There are no modifiers that can affect it. This level can affect character unlocks like larger [saved step](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Saved_steps "Saved steps") amounts and additional [toolbelt](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Toolbelt "Toolbelt") slots.

For [activities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") involving two skills, the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

When performing an [activity](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") for a skill, only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).
