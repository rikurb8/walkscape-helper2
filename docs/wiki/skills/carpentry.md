# Carpentry

> Process raw logs into components of precise measurement to craft useful items with.

The **Carpentry** [skill](index.md) is primarily used to process [material](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Material "Material") like logs into planks, and later on, the plan is to include building farm buildings. With higher carpentry levels, you'll have access to more logs and special skilling [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that can boost your carpentry efficiency. You can also receive [Carpentry Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Carpentry_Chests "Carpentry Chests") as a rare drop from training this skill.

## Activities

The following [activities](../activities/index.md) can be done indefinitely without needing [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Some have [equipment requirements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords#Gear_and_Tool_Keywords "Keywords") or other requirements that need to be satisfied in order to start the activity.

For [activities](../activities/index.md) involving two [skills](index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

So, if the [activity](../activities/index.md) has a Carpentry level requirement, it will be eligible to drop [Carpentry Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Carpentry_chest "Carpentry chest").

When performing an [activity](../activities/index.md) for a [skill](index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).

The following activities are eligible to drop [Carpentry Chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Carpentry_chest "Carpentry chest").

### Bonus Experience Sources

No activities give bonus Carpentry experience.

## Recipes

The following activities are completed through recipes and thus require [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"). Additionally, they may have service requirements, usually in the form of a service location. All recipes produce one of the final products by default.

Carpentry also gets a bonus of +1 [Crafting Outcome](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_Outcome "Crafting Outcome") per level beyond a [Carpentry Recipe's](../recipes/index.md) level requirement toward [crafted items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_items "Crafted items") with no cap.

The following activities are eligible to drop [Carpentry chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Carpentry_chest "Carpentry chest").

## Services
