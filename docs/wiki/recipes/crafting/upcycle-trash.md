# Upcycle trash

Upcycle trash is a special [Crafting](../../skills/crafting.md) recipe with nonstandard outputs. It always gives 1 [Wood scrap](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Wood_scrap "Wood scrap") but it also rolls on its own table to determine what the trash contains.

This output can be normal or [fine quality](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fine_Material "Fine Material") for the materials. This does use any [fine material finding](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fine_Material_Finding "Fine Material Finding") (global or crafting) you may have.

## Primary Recipe Output
