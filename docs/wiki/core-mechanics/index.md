# Core Mechanics

## Welcome to WalkScape!

### Walk for In-Game Progress

In WalkScape, in-game progress happens as you step in real life. Steps are counted by the pedometer on your phone and applied in real time to the game.

The core gameplay loop revolves around selecting a [skill](../skills/index.md) activity (e.g. chopping pine logs, ocean fishing, crafting iron axes, [traveling](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Traveling "Traveling") to another location in the game), and taking a certain number of steps to complete that action. Once you complete an action, you gain [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials"), [coins](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Coins "Coins"), and if you are lucky - even [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") or other rare drops. Your character then begins the action again if it is possible. This continues until you select a new activity in-game.

If it is no longer possible to continue your action in-game (e.g. you run out of materials, you reach your destination in-game, etc.) and you are still taking steps in real life, there is a small buffer called [Saved Steps](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Saved_steps "Saved steps") (sometimes also referred to as the "**Step Bank**") that will become charged. Once you select a new activity, one step from the step bank will apply to your current activity for each step you take in life. So, if you stored 3000 steps in the step bank by being idle in-game, the next 3000 steps in real life will be doubled in-game. The Saved Steps are a limited resource whose size grows with [character level](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Character_Level "Character Level"), so it's best to pay attention to how long you can do various activities.

### [Skills](../skills/index.md)

There are 10 skills in the WalkScape: [Agility](../skills/agility.md), [Carpentry](../skills/carpentry.md), [Cooking](../skills/cooking.md), [Crafting](../skills/crafting.md), [Foraging](../skills/foraging.md), [Fishing](../skills/fishing.md), [Mining](../skills/mining.md), [Smithing](../skills/smithing.md), [Trinketry](../skills/trinketry.md) and [Woodcutting](../skills/woodcutting.md). Head over to the [skills](../skills/index.md) page to learn more. Skills are trained by activities in game.

### [Character Level](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Character_Level "Character Level")

In addition to skills, your account has an overall [Character Level](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Character_Level "Character Level"). This level describes the total number of steps you have taken over your account lifetime, and is important for some types of overall account progression such as unlocking [toolbelt](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Toolbelt "Toolbelt") slots and increasing the [saved steps](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Character_Level "Character Level") maximum.

### [Items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Items "Items")

There are many types of items in WalkScape:

- [Crafted](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_Items "Crafted Items"). These are typically obtained mainly by crafting them yourself or buying one that's been crafted by someone else.
- [Loot](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Loot_Items "Loot Items"). You can gain loot from shops, [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests"), dead enemies, randomly from some [activities](../activities/index.md), quest rewards and so forth.
- [Equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment"). Is divided up into [gear](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Gear "Gear") and [tools](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Tools "Tools"), that can be equipped to your character. They will be either [Crafted](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_Items "Crafted Items") or [Loot](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Loot_Items "Loot Items") themselves too.
- [Material](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Material_Items "Material Items"). They're what's used to [craft](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_Items "Crafted Items") other [items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Items "Items"). Pretty self explanatory.
- [Consumables](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Consumables "Consumables"). They're things like potions and food which can be consumed to heal yourself or to gain a buff.
- [Treasury](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Treasury "Treasury"). They do not need an [inventory](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") space and can be opened. These contain other [items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Items "Items").
- Quest. These don't need an [inventory](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") space and are used in quests to progress.
- [Collectibles](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Collectibles "Collectibles"). These do not take up [inventory](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") space and are always with your character.

### [Achievements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Achievements "Achievements")

The Closed Beta Test currently contains over 70 [achievements](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Achievements "Achievements"). Getting half of the achievement points in the game will earn the player a [Cape of Half-Achiever](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Cape_of_Half-Achiever "Cape of Half-Achiever"), and getting all of the achievement points will earn the player the [Cape of Achiever](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Cape_of_Achiever "Cape of Achiever").
