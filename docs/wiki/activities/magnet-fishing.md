# Trivia

-   Normally Copper, gold and silver are generally non-magnetic Arenum magnets are just built different.
-   Prior to the Trinketry update the Heron trinket was a "Ring of the heron" and the only way to complete the [My Precious](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/My_Precious "Special:MyLanguage/My Precious") achievement. The old rings were added to make up for the fact that the trinket no longer qualifies for that achievement.
