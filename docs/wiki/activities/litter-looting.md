# Trivia

- Finding [raw shrimp](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Raw_shrimp "Special:MyLanguage/Raw shrimp") from litter looting is a reference to Sorgo, a WalkScape artist intern. During the alpha testing they would constantly go [fishing](../skills/fishing.md) to get shrimp, and just when they finally had a good pile of it - their character would end up getting wiped. This happened over and over, thus litter looting is the culmination of all their lost shrimp.
