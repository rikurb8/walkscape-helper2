# Activities

There are a multitude of **Activities** that can be done in WalkScape throughout the world of [Arenum](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Arenum "Arenum").

When you select an activity, you begin completing actions of that activity until it no longer becomes possible to continue completing actions, or you select to do another activity. Actions are one completion of an activity, and reward things like experience, a chance at a [chest](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests"), and create or transform [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials").

There are roughly three categories of activities in the game:

- Near-infinitely repeatable - Many gathering activities will produce an action every set number of steps until you tell your character to do something else. For example, if you select [Cut Pine Trees](cut-pine-trees.md) as your activity, your character will continue chopping pine logs until you tell them to do otherwise. You will continue doing this activity at maximum efficiency until hitting the inventory soft-cap, or stopping when you are [overencumbered](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Overencumbered "Overencumbered") - if you have the setting toggled on.
- Finitely repeatable - [Recipes](../recipes/index.md) and [traveling](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Traveling "Traveling") activities generally produce a finite amount of possible actions. When selecting an activity such as [Cut a Pine Plank](../skills/carpentry.md), you can select how many actions you want to perform up to the maximum available based on the [materials](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Materials "Materials") you have available to you, and the game will predict how many steps this will take you to complete. When [traveling](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Traveling "Traveling") is your activity, your character will travel until reaching their destination.
- [Movement](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Movement_Activities "Movement Activities") - These activities will cause you to appear in a different location after one action completed. This includes activities that are normally available like [Venture Into The Bog](venture-into-the-bog.md) as well as emergency escape activities that are anti-soft lock activities to make sure you aren't trapped in a location without the required gear to travel like [Emergency Swim Escape](emergency-swim-escape.md).

Steps that you take while the game is active on your screen (foreground) are applied in real time to your current activity. If you close or background the game, the steps that you take will be immediately applied upon foregrounding the app or loading into the game.

[Leveling](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Skill_Experience "Skill Experience") a [skill](../skills/index.md) grants 1.25% [Work Efficiency](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") toward the attributed skill's activity up to a maximum of 25% or 20 levels above that of the required level to perform the activity.

[Skills](../skills/index.md) that can, will also benefit from a bonus of +1 [Crafting Outcome](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting_Outcome "Crafting Outcome") per respective level beyond a [Recipe's](../recipes/index.md) level requirement toward [crafted items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_items "Crafted items") with no cap.

For activities involving two [skills](../skills/index.md), the player is only eligible to earn [chests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chests "Chests") in skills that have actual level requirements.

When performing an activity for a [skill](../skills/index.md), only the primary skill is factored in for the player's [equipment](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") bonuses, the "2nd Skill" will also be affected by the equipment [attributes](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") based toward the "1st Skill" (IE: +1 Exp will apply to the "2nd Skill" as well).
