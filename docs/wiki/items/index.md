# Items

Items are objects that can be collected, used, or sold. They can be found in the world, bought from vendors, or crafted by players.

In WalkScape, items are a core part of what you will be walking for. They can be found, crafted, bought or achieved. Each category of items has their own role to play in how to interact with the World of Arenum. Items can be modified in many cases by [keywords](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Keywords "Keywords") that determine how they interact with activities other items and the inventory.

## Crafted Items

**[Crafted Items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafted_Items "Crafted Items")**: These are items you can equip and the only way to get them is by crafting them yourself or buying one that's been crafted by someone else. This can be done using the [Crafting](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") or [Smithing](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Smithing "Smithing") skill.

**Examples**:

-   [Wooden sword](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Wooden_sword "Wooden sword")
-   [Tarsilium shield](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Tarsilium_shield "Tarsilium shield")

## Loot Items

**[Loot Items](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Loot_Items "Loot Items")**: These are also things you can equip, but they differ from the crafted items by being randomly dropped from different things or activities. You can gain loot from [chests](chests.md), dead enemies, randomly from some [activities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities"), quest rewards and so forth.

**Examples**:

-   [Feather cape](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Feather_cape "Feather cape")
-   [Cool sunglasses](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Cool_sunglasses "Cool sunglasses")

## Material Items

**[Material Items](materials.md)**: These are the ingredients used to craft other items. Generally these are gathered from [skills](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Skills "Skills") such as [fishing](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fishing "Fishing"), [foraging](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Foraging "Foraging"), [mining](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Mining "Mining"), and the like.

**Examples**:

-   [Farganite ore](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Farganite_ore "Farganite ore")
-   [Fishing line](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Fishing_line "Fishing line")

## Consumable Items

**[Consumable](consumables.md)/Usable Items**: These are things like potions and food which can be consumed to heal yourself or to gain a buff thus making crafting items easier, helping you to defeat enemies and so forth.

**Examples**:

-   [Beer](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Beer "Beer")
-   [Cooked squid](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Cooked_squid "Cooked squid")

## Openable Items

**[Openable Items](chests.md)**: These contain other items. They do not need an [inventory](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") space and can be opened anywhere. Most often you'll gain these randomly from [activities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") or as rewards and they have a drop table that can give you a plethora of interesting drops.

**Examples**:

-   [Sunken chest](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Sunken_chest "Sunken chest")
-   [Smithing chest](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Smithing_chest "Smithing chest")

## Collectible Items

**[Collectible Items](collectibles.md)**: There is not much known about these items except that they are very rare. These are like the Mona Lisa of the item world.

**Examples**:

-   [Soup kitchen badge](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Soup_kitchen_badge "Soup kitchen badge")
-   [Old war sword](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Old_war_sword "Old war sword")

## Ability Items
