# Collectibles

**Collectibles** are special [items](index.md) that require no [inventory](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") space and get added automatically once found under your Character icon > Achievements > Special Items > Collectibles. If they have an effect, it will be applied permanently to your character. They cannot be sold or stack once obtained, so obtaining more than one gives no benefits. When obtained from an [activity](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities"), they drop from their own table, and thus do not take away other drop opportunities. Each collectible also grants 1 [Achievement Point](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Achievement_Points "Achievement Points") helping you to progress towards rewards and unlocks.
