# Chests

**Chests** are openable [items](index.md) that drop at a base **1/250 rate** per action from doing [activities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") (with the exception of [traveling](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Traveling "Traveling")). Their type is determined by the activity's [skills](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Skills "Skills") involved that have actual level requirements and not the experience obtained. This can lead to some activities having the potential to drop more than one chest type in a single action. If an activity can drop more than one chest or openable, they each have an independent 1/250 base drop rate as well.

When acquired, they do not take up space, but instead they will be displayed in your [treasury](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Treasury "Treasury") tab under your [Inventory](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") where they can be viewed or opened from there. The rewards for a chest are rolled upon opening, not upon receiving the chest.

The [**Chest Finding**](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Chest_Finding_\(Mechanics\) "Chest Finding (Mechanics)") equipment [attribute](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") can add to the base drop rate of finding chests during [activities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities"). So [equipment](equipment.md) with "**+1%** **Chest Finding"** gives a new chance of **1.01/250** per roll on the chest loot table (does not affect the ability to find [Bird Nests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Bird_Nests "Bird Nests")).

While uniquely, the **[Find Bird Nests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Find_Bird_Nests_\(Mechanics\) "Find Bird Nests (Mechanics)")** equipment [attribute](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Attributes "Attributes") can add to the base 1/250 drop rate of finding [Bird Nests](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Bird_Nests "Bird Nests") during their obtainable [activities](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Activities "Activities") in the same manner.

## Loot Rolls

All chests go through four rolls for [loot](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Loot_Items "Loot Items"). Each of those rolls gets broken up into two separate rolls. The first part of a roll goes based on the table below. After rolling on that, it will then roll for an item based on the sub-table involved.

If a chest has a sub-table or tables that are blank the games adds that chance onto the miscellaneous table's chances.

Please note that the chances for loot are based off of the individual rolls and not the total amount given by a chest/treasury item itself.

## Chest Types

There are some cases where certain activities can give unique openables in addition to the skill chests.

## Unavailable

These regional chests are not currently in the game yet, but they sure look cool! There is no info on acquiring them yet.
